[Here](https://hiv-forecasting-ph-dashboard.web.app/) is the link to the website.

The system's homepage provides a dashboard for users to interact with the data and generate a new forecast.
The system offers visualization of the number of HIV cases in the Philippines, together 
with the forecasts made by the selected model in my study. It also allows users to visualize the number of cases
within specific dates.

Users can add new values by either clicking on the 'Add' or the 'Upload' button. By clicking on the 'Add' button,
new cells in the table are generated for users to fill in, whereas by clicking on the 'Upload' button, users can
upload a CSV file that appends its values to the table. Further, users can only make changes with the data they added. 
By selecting the 'Select' button, they can simultaneously select cells to edit or delete. Users can also make a 
separate edit by double-clicking the cell.

The login page allows the admin to access the admin page. Changes in the table of the said page are saved in the database and 
updated to the data the users can see. Similarly, the admin can add data the same way as users, 
but they can change all the values. When uploading a CSV file, the admin can choose between appending the values to the table 
or replacing all values with the values of the file. The admin can also change the starting date of the series.
